# Pranzo App

APP for an e-commerce app, for university purposes only.

With this app, it is possible to register and log in as a customer user, 
where you can see the dishes on the menu, add or remove them from 
the shopping cart, as well as pay for your order and track your 
order. On the other hand, you can access as an administrator user 
(which is created manually in the database) where you can create 
dishes, delete them, modify them and manage the orders to be 
delivered and confirmed.
